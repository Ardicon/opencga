# Provide hadoop configuration manually

In case of not having the hadoop binaries installed in the node used to interact with hadoop, we need to provide the configuration manually.

 1. Take the configuration files from the cluster hadoop
 2. Place them into the folder `conf/hadoop` in the installation directory. This folder is automatically added to the classpath.
