README


In this folder, users should store external files to be used by some OpenCGA analysis.

1) roleInCancer.txt[.gz]

This file is used by interpretation clinical analysis, e.g., Tiering and TEAM analysis.

It stores those genes which contain mutations that have been casually implicated in cancer. This information can be downloaded
from the Cancer Gene Census (CGC) at https://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/census

The file consists of two tab-separated columns: the first one contains the gene name, and the second, the role in cancer, i.e.: oncogne,
TSG, fusion. In addition, lines starting with # are considered comments and will be ignored.

Sample of a roleInCancer file:

#Gene name	Role in Cancer
A1CF	oncogene
ABI1	TSG, fusion
ABL1	oncogene, fusion
ABL2	oncogene, fusion
ACKR3	oncogene, fusion
ACSL3	fusion

2) actionableVariants_xxx.txt[.gz] where xxx = assembly, e.g.: grch37

This file is used by interpretation clinical analysis, e.g., TEAM analysis.

It stores variants that were identified as clinically actionable variants. The file consists of the following twelve tab-separated columns:
  - Chromosome
  - Start
  - Stop
  - Reference allele
  - Alternate allele
  - dbSNP ID
  - ClinVar Variant ID
  - HGVS
  - Phenotype list
  - Clinical significance
  - Review status
  - Submitter categories

In addition, lines starting with # are considered comments and will be ignored.

Sample fo an actionableVariants file:
